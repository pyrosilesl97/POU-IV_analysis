# POU-IV_analysis

This repository includes the code used for the analyses performed in the publication "Cnidarian hair cell development illuminates an ancient role for the class IV POU transcription factor in defining mechanoreceptor identity" created by Pablo Yamild Rosiles Loeza, as part of the 
Regulatory RNA Lab at LANGEBIO, Mexico. 

Any information regarding the present repository can be consulted in any of the contact means of this laboratory (http://regrnalab.github.io) or directly with the creator at the e-mail pablo.rosiles[at]cinvestav.mx.

The R code named Data_analysis.R has the code base used, however, a markdown copy is located in the Rmkdown folder. For a more interactive visualization it is recommended to consult the Rmkdown/Data_analysis.html visible in any browser of your choice. 

The publication can be found at
[Full publication data needs to be added].

I personally thank and acknowledge Dr. Nagayasu Nakanishi and Dr. Selene Fernandez for their valuable comments and support.
